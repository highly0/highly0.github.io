Hi there! I am currently an applied research engineer at the GenAI & AI Optimization Lab at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/). I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) and Master of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science from the [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology](https://new.skoltech.ru/en/). Previously, I was a Research Engineer at Skoltech at the Skoltech \& SberAI NLP Lab.

Iâ€™m excited by Large Language Models (LLMs). More specifically, my main research interest are **understanding LLMs**  (interpretability, explainability, uncertainty estimation), and **making LLMs more accessible for researchers and engineers** (model compression/optimization, multilingual models, improving transfer learning/downstream tasks).
