Hi there! I am a recent graduate from the [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology](https://new.skoltech.ru/en/) with a Master of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently a NLP Research Engineer at Skoltech, funded by Sber AI. Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/). 

Iâ€™m excited by Large Language Models (LLMs). More specifically, my main research interest are **understanding LLMs**  (interpretability, explainability, uncertainty estimation), and **making LLMs more accessible for researchers and engineers** (model compression/optimization, multilingual models, improving transfer learning/downstream tasks).
